	"description": "Winter has arrived in the Isle of Tir-Na-nOg.  The Highlands are now mostly covered in snow and the decidious trees have dropped their leaves.  You better can handle the cold and be in love with snow...\n\nNote, this is the EXACT same map as the Isle of Tir-Na-nOg - it is the winter version that you can swap with the other seasons, without it damaging your builds and placeables.\n\nMost of the retexturing work (she now can no longer stand the snow) is done by ErynLyn\nalso big thanks to Hemi who made the chimney smoke.  What is a winter village without smoke coming from the fires in the houses?\n\nsteam ID  2781732665",
